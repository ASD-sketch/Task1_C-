//1.What is a Class ?
//A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines properties, methods, and behaviors that objects of the class will have.


//2.What is an Object ?
//An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and contains data (fields) and functionality (methods) defined by its class.


//3.Difference Between Class and Object
//Class: Blueprint or definition; does not occupy memory.
//Object: Instance of a class; occupies memory and can interact with other objects.


//4. OOP Principles
//Encapsulation: Hiding internal details and providing controlled access.
//Abstraction: Focusing on essential features while hiding complexities.
//Inheritance: Reusing code by deriving one class from another.
//Polymorphism: Allowing methods to have different behaviors based on the object.


//5. What is a Property?
//A property provides controlled access to a class's private fields using get and set.



//6.What is a Field ?
//A field is a variable defined in a class to store data directly.



//7. What is a Constructor?
//A constructor is a special method called automatically when an object is created, used to initialize the object.



//8. What is Encapsulation?
//Encapsulation is the practice of restricting direct access to class fields and providing access through properties or methods to ensure security and integrity.
